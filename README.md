Built on [`terra-python-sdk`](https://github.com/terra-project/terra-sdk-python) from the legends at [Terra](http://terra.money/)\
Just took the API parts and modified to work with [Akash](https://akash.network/) blockchain.\
\
This does *not* allow you to send any transactions to the chain, for that please use the official akash software.\
Solely for block exploration purposes on a Python interface.
